 Further small changes have been made in March 2006.

 Paul Gilmartin discovered that TXT records with a text byte count of
 zero are rejected by the Program Binder.  This is allowed by the
 Linkage Editor.  Since the Linkage Editor does not seem to require
 text for every control section, simply suppressing this TXT record
 fixes this problem.

 Looking at this problem made it apparent that my earlier 1999 changes
 exploit Binder control statements not available with the Linkage
 Editor.  If this is a problem then use an editor to delete these
 control statements, such as SETOPT.

 Additional changes to support 64-bit addressing mode have been made.
 No changes to support 64-bit residency have been made since the
 Contents Supervisor will not currently load programs "above the bar".

 I compile this program with PL/I for MVS and VM (V1), which will
 almost certainly be the last of the OS heritage PL/I compilers.

 I have not tried to compile it with VisualAge PL/I (V2) or
 Enterprise PL/I (V3) - which have closer ties to C code generation,
 and thus would probably not work with all of the DWN subroutines.

 The main inhibitor of moving to the latest compiler would be the
 BPAM support.  Once the details of this have been worked out the
 remaining DWN subroutines could probably be replaced by newer PL/I
 built-in functions.  Note that the program is currently reentrant
 in the OS sense.  Newer compilers only support "C-style" reentrancy
 where the executable should not be marked as RENT.
